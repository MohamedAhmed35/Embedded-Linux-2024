# C++ Programming Language
## Difference between C and C++
- C:
  - Procedural programming language.
  - Focuses on functions and procedures to operate on data.
  - No built-in support for OPP (Object-Oriented Programming).
  - Does not support function overloading.
  - No support for generic programming (templates).
  - Uses **stdio.h** for input and output.
- C++:
  - Support both procedural and object-oriented programming.
  - Emphasizes objects and data abstraction.
  - Supports function overloading and operator overloading.
  - Provides templates for generic programming.
  - Uses **iostream** for input and output.

## Introduction and Usage
C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language. It is widely used in system/software development, game development, drivers, client-server applications, and embedded firmware.

## Main Features
- **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)**: Support classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and 
  abstraction.
- **Statically Typed Language**: Type checking is performed at compile-time.
- **STL (Standard Template Library)**: Provides a set of common classes and interfaces for data structures and 
  algorithms.
